Welcome! üëã  
I am **Taewoo Kim**, a Senior Research Engineer at **Qualcomm Korea**, specializing in **computational imaging**, **event-based vision**, and **generative AI for camera systems**.  
My research focuses on developing unified frameworks that enhance and restore videos captured under challenging illumination or motion conditions ‚Äî particularly low-light enhancement, deblurring, and frame interpolation using event cameras.

---

### üî¨ Research Focus
I aim to bridge **physics-based sensing** and **generative intelligence**, building next-generation vision systems that perceive and reconstruct the world beyond conventional frame-based imaging.  
My current interests include:
- Event-guided video enhancement and deblurring  
- Diffusion-based and transformer-based video restoration  
- Generative imaging systems for HDR and low-light environments  
- Multimodal sensing (RGB + Event + IMU + Depth fusion)

### üß† Background
I received my **Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering** from **KAIST**, where I worked on computational imaging and event-based video processing.  
My doctoral research proposed **event-guided deep learning frameworks** for low-light video enhancement and interpolation, published in top-tier conferences such as **CVPR**, **ECCV**, and **ICCV** (including an *oral* and *highlight* paper).

Currently, at Qualcomm, I am working on machine learning‚Äìbased camera algorithms, focusing on **video denoising, HDR imaging, and AI-enhanced ISP design**.

### üåç Beyond Research
I enjoy bridging the gap between **academic research** and **real-world imaging systems**, exploring the frontier of **Generative Computational Photography** ‚Äî where sensors meet creativity.  
Outside of research, I love **weight training**, **coffee**, and exploring cities with a camera in hand.
