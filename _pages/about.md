### üî¨ Bio
Hi, I am a researcher and engineer specializing in **computer vision** and **machine learning**, with a focus on **computational photography**.  
During my graduate studies, I conducted extensive research on **video frame interpolation**, **motion deblurring**, **low-light video enhancement**, and **HDR imaging**, leveraging **machine learning** and **event-based vision sensors** to tackle challenging problems in computational imaging.  
My works have been published in top-tier conferences such as **CVPR**, **ICCV**, and **ECCV**, with several selected for **oral** and **highlight** presentations.  
I am passionate about bridging **cutting-edge research** with **real-world applications**, particularly in **generative AI** and **imaging pipelines**.
