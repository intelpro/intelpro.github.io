### ðŸ”¬ Bio
Hi, I am a researcher and engineer specializing in computer vision and machine learning, with a focus on computational photography. During my graduate studies, I conducted extensive research on video frame interpolation, motion deblurring, low-light video enhancement, and HDR imaging, leveraging machine learning techniques and event-based vision sensors to address challenging problems in computational imaging. My research has been published in top-tier venues such as CVPR, ICCV, and ECCV, with several works selected for oral and highlight presentations. I am passionate about bridging cutting-edge research with real-world applications, especially in generative AI and imaging pipelines.
