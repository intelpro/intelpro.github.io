## ðŸ”¬ Bio
Hi, I am a researcher and engineer specializing in computer vision and machine learning, with a focus on computational photography. I am currently working at Qualcomm as a Senior Research Engineer, developing AI-driven camera algorithms. During my Ph.D. at KAIST, I studied computational photography using novel event-based sensors, focusing on low-light enhancement, deblurring, and video interpolation. I am passionate about bridging cutting-edge research with real-world applications, particularly in generative AI and intelligent imaging systems.
